* TODO headline_1
  This section contains headlines that span from one day or week into
  the next, or include daylight saving time switches. The outcome that
  /Emacs/ produces is displayed in the  clock tables below. The test
  verifies that OrgModeParser calculates the same way. 
** headline_1_1
   CLOCK: [2015-03-26 Thu 23:00]--[2015-03-27 Fri 01:30] =>  2:30
   One hour on Thursday, 1.5 on Friday.
** headline_1_2
   CLOCK: [2015-03-29 Sun 23:00]--[2015-03-30 Mon 01:30] =>  2:30
   One hour on Sunday, 1.5 on Monday.
** headline_1_3
   CLOCK: [2015-03-28 Sat 18:00]--[2015-03-29 Sun 06:00] => 11:00
   In Germany, Sat March 28, 2015 marks the switch to CEST. Because of
   that, the above clock entry only spans 11 hours. How does OrgMode
   know which regional regulations apply?
